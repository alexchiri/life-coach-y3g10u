# Life Coach 2 - App Specification

## Executive Summary

Life Coach 2 is a private, AI-powered Android application designed to help adults discover and validate viable life paths through structured experimentation. Using the PACT framework (Purposeful, Actionable, Continuous, Trackable), the app guides users through personalized coaching sessions that identify potential pursue paths and generate small experiments to validate which direction resonates most authentically.

**Target Platform:** Android 14+ (API 34)  
**Core Technology:** Claude Sonnet 3.5 AI integration  
**Data Approach:** Local-only, encrypted storage  
**User Base:** Adults seeking self-improvement and life direction

---

## Core Concept

### The Problem
Many adults struggle to identify meaningful life directions and feel paralyzed by major life decisions. Traditional goal-setting often fails because it lacks experimental validation.

### The Solution
Life Coach 2 transforms life exploration into a series of small, manageable experiments. Rather than committing to massive changes, users test potential paths through PACT-compliant experiments that provide real-world validation of what truly aligns with their values and interests.

### The PACT Framework
Every experiment in the app follows four principles:

- **Purposeful:** Aligned with user's curiosity and core values
- **Actionable:** Clear, specific actions that can be taken immediately
- **Continuous:** Sustained over a user-defined period
- **Trackable:** Easy to monitor progress and measure outcomes
